# üß† Content Moderation API

This project is a RESTful API for automated moderation of user-generated content. It performs binary classification of text input to detect **toxic language**, **insults**, and **hate speech**.

## üî¨ Models

The API delegates inference to hosted models on Hugging Face Inference Endpoints. Each classifier is optimized for a specific moderation task:

- [Toxic Comment Classifier](https://huggingface.co/framonmar7/toxic-classifier) ‚Äì Detects general toxicity.
- [Insult Comment Classifier](https://huggingface.co/framonmar7/insult-classifier) ‚Äì Detects offensive or insulting language.
- [Hate Speech Classifier](https://huggingface.co/framonmar7/hate-classifier) ‚Äì Detects hate speech or discriminatory language.

All models are finetuned on labeled datasets and are intended to be used as modular components of the moderation pipeline.

## üìö Swagger Documentation

Interactive API documentation is automatically generated via **Swagger UI** and available at:

```
/swagger/
```

Each endpoint accepts a `POST` request with a JSON body containing a single `text` field.

Example:

```json
{
  "text": "You're worthless and stupid."
}
```

The response includes a `label` and a `score` (confidence).

```

2. **Create your environment file**:

Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and provide the values:

```env
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DJANGO_DEBUG=True
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

3. **Prepare the backend**:

```bash
python manage.py migrate

## üö¶ Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse, the API uses `django-ratelimit` to limit excessive requests. Requests exceeding the threshold will receive HTTP 429 responses.
